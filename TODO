 1. Get accurate fonts for Arabic, Russian and Greek. If you use these locales
    in Linux, please write me and tell me what their normal UI fonts are.

 2. Add support for Uyghur, Thai, Tibetan, Malay and other languages.

 3. Should I add further support to let users actually specify unique locales
    instead of pigeon-holing them into the nearest match? Users, please reply!
