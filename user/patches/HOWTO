 This folder is reserved for you to create your own custom font patches.

 Copy the "custom" folder to a new folder an begin editing the included locale
 files to change the fonts however you like. It is recommended you not directly
 add new font lines to the file, otherwise, they will not be reverted when
 unpatching after Wine terminates.

 If you discover new fonts that need to be patches to guarantee function in
 one of the supported locales, or you would like to see a new locale added,
 please email Derrick Sobodash at <dsobodash@sina.com>.

 If you want a new locale added, you should be prepared to supply:

 1. Which Windows fonts contain this locale's glyphs; don't say "Tahoma"
 2. Which Linux fonts contain this locale's glyphs
 3. A small application which uses this locale and can run in Wine
